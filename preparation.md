#### License

When your three-month free trial expires, you will need to get a new valid license file from FORCS. 

1. Change the new license file name to **`license.xml.`** 
2. Replace the old license file **`(C:\Program Files (x86)\FORCS\OZ Report 8.0\OZ Query Designer 8.0\license.xml)`**    with the new **`license.xml`.**

## Sample Database

We will use MySQL for the sample database and you can create your own sample database on your computer.

Download the sample database from ðŸ‘‰ [here ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HErhwbrADsCTqiNLfSS3lHzrK9gOBhPQ/view)and import it into your database.

If you are not able to create your sample database, you can still connect to the sample database on the AWS cloud.
