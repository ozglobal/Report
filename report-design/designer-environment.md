## Band

OZ Report Designer uses a "band-oriented" design approach. A Report Band represents a specific area on a report page, used to specify where and when, and how the report components are to be displayed on the report. All components in the report (label, table, crosstab, chart, shape, input component, etc.) are located in one of several bands.â€Œ
